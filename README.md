SLURM Generator
===============

This tool helps users generate SLURM batch scripts for the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology's Biocluster (https://biocluster.igb.illinois.edu)[https://biocluster.igb.illinois.edu].  Allows them to interactively build their SLURM script. As job parameters are entered into the form, the SLURM script is generated in real time.
